1
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,971
I'm goin' down to South Park,
gonna have myself a time.

2
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:14,140
Friendly faces everywhere.

3
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:15,641
Humble folks
without temptation.

4
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:18,602
Goin' down to South Park,
gonna leave my woes behind.

5
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:20,021
Ample parking day or night.

6
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:22,064
People spouting,
"Howdy, neighbor!"

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,317
Heading on up to South Park,
gonna see if I can't unwind.

8
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,153
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, Timmy.

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,071
Timmy, Timmy,
liv-a-la, Timmy!

10
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:32,575
Come on down to South Park
and meet some friends of mine.

11
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:36,787
Okay, children.

12
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:38,289
Step off the bus
and form a group

13
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,583
next to the nice redneck...
I mean rancher.

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,335
Hello, boys and girls.
My name is Rancher Bob.

15
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,962
Let's all say hello
to Rancher Bob.

16
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,547
Hi, Rancher Bob.

17
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,133
I'm pleased to show you all
the wonderful world of beef.

18
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:50,509
Follow me.

19
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,762
City kids get to go to museums
for field trips.

20
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:53,929
We get cow farms.

21
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:55,806
Now, out here,
you can see our cattle.

22
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,391
This is where the magic begins

23
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,644
as the cows eat, sleep,
and prepare for certain death.

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,190
They look so delicious.

25
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,358
Now, here we have
the slaughterhouse.

26
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,779
This is where we turn the cows
into steaks and burgers!

27
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:10,738
Ew!

28
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:11,739
Aw, dude!

29
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,616
Anybody want a free sample?

30
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,784
Me! Me! Me! Me!

31
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,662
And in here, boys and girls,
we have our veal ranch.

32
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:31,258
You see, with veal, the whole
key is keeping the cows chained

33
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,427
so they can't walk around
or get any exercise.

34
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,638
That way,
their muscle tissue stays soft

35
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,556
and makes for tender veal.

36
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,851
Wait a minute.
Veal is... little baby cows?

37
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:41,852
Yepper!

38
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,577
Then why the hell
do they call it "veal"?

39
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,206
Well, if we called it
"little baby cow",

40
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:46,315
people might not eat it.

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,234
- Yeah! I wouldn't have!
- Uh, me neither.

42
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,693
Oh, man!
Look at that one!

43
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:51,987
- It looks delicious!
- What?

44
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,447
Succulent and juicy.

45
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:55,132
Can we have a free sample
of these, too?

46
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:55,991
Well, no.

47
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:58,244
But all these veals are going
to the slaughterhouse

48
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,078
tomorrow morning.

49
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,514
They'll be steaks
by the afternoon,

50
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,307
and then you can buy them
at your grocery store.

51
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,207
All right!

52
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:04,458
Tomorrow morning?

53
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,463
Dude, we got to help them.

54
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,588
Yeah.

55
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,139
Psst! Cartman.

56
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:19,890
No! Uncle Jesse!
No!

57
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,015
Cartman, wake up!

58
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,893
What? What the hell
are you guys doing?

59
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,895
- Come on! We got to go!
- Where are we going?

60
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,981
We're gonna go save
the little baby cows, fat ass.

61
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:27,815
What? Why?

62
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,626
'Cause they're gonna get
slaughtered tomorrow, butthole!

63
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,276
So?

64
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:31,545
So we can't let 'em die,
douchebag.

65
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,004
You're our friend.
Now, come help us.

66
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,073
Well, in the last 3.2 seconds,
you've called me "fat ass",

67
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,324
"butthole", and "douchebag".

68
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,410
I really don't feel much
like you guys' friend.

69
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,995
We're sorry.
You are our friend.

70
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,240
We need you to help us
because friends stick together.

71
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:43,831
Wait.

72
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,684
I thought you said we needed him
because he has

73
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,918
the "Mission: Impossible
Breaking-and-Entering Playset".

74
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,545
Damn it, Butters.
Will you shut up?

75
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,463
So you need me

76
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,692
and my "Mission: Impossible
Breaking-and-Entering Playset".

77
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:54,758
Yes, we do.

78
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,444
We're those little baby cows'
only hope.

79
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,344
Will you help us?

80
00:02:57,469 --> 00:02:59,305
Yes.
Yes, I will.

81
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,931
If Kyle will kiss my black ass.

82
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:01,849
What?!

83
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,614
Just give it a little kiss,
and I'll help.

84
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:04,602
Screw you, Cartman!

85
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:05,871
Okay, but if you want my help,

86
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,330
you have to give it
just a little kiss.

87
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,063
Kiss it.

88
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:09,732
- Go on, dude. It's the only way.
- No!

89
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,150
Kiss it.
Come on. Kiss it!

90
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,755
Just do it really fast,
and we can go.

91
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,112
- Have Butters kiss it.
- No. It has to be Kyle.

92
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,414
Oh, man!
That was so awesome!

93
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,458
Sick!
I felt it on my face!

94
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:29,143
Okay. Very funny, Cartman.
Now, come on.

95
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,628
I'm not going with you.

96
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:32,630
- Aah!
- Hey!

97
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,551
I don't know about this, fellas.

98
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,385
It says right here

99
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,488
on the "Mission: Impossible
Breaking-and-Entering Playset"...

100
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,806
"Not for actual breaking
and entering.

101
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,725
Breaking and entering
is a crime."

102
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,286
Well, killing little helpless
baby cows

103
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,186
should be a crime, too.

104
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,496
How does this thing work,
Cartman?

105
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,147
Jesus.
Don't you guys have any toys?

106
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,899
First you put on
the black ski mask

107
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,860
and use the torch
to cut a hole in the roof.

108
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,120
Okay.
That's far enough.

109
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,140
- I'm going to go delta.
- You have to talk louder!

110
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,164
I forgot the AA batteries

111
00:04:08,249 --> 00:04:09,769
for the Super Talk Play-Action
headset.

112
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,543
I said that's far enough!

113
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,259
Don't be scared,
little baby cow.

114
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,344
We're here to set you loose.

115
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,012
There you go.
You're free!

116
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,056
Run away!

117
00:04:24,181 --> 00:04:25,766
Go!
They're gonna murder you!

118
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,143
Stan, could you hurry it up?
I'm freezing my ass off.

119
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,829
You need to freeze
some of your ass off.

120
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,563
At least I have an ass, Jew!

121
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,689
What?

122
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,652
Come on, you stupid baby cows!

123
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,904
You have to get out of here!

124
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,658
- What's the matter?
- They aren't leaving!

125
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,619
See? Maybe they want to become
sweet, juicy veal steaks.

126
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,584
Hey, they've never been allowed
to walk before.

127
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,663
They just don't know how!

128
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:50,791
Oh, yeah.
They're too weak to move.

129
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,520
We've got to get them
out of here.

130
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:54,646
We'll keep them
at Butters' house

131
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,855
until they can get
their strength back.

132
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,131
No, no, no, no, no!

133
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,616
I can't bring calves
into my house.

134
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,396
- I'll get grounded.
- Okay. Fine, Butters.

135
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,778
I guess you're not
a team player.

136
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:02,904
We'll bring them to my house.

137
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,014
Dude, how are we gonna move
23 calves to your house?

138
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,724
- I don't know.
- I've got it!

139
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,933
We could kill Butters

140
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,935
and then float the calves
on a river of blood.

141
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,936
Don't be stupid, Cartman!

142
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,414
Butters doesn't have
that much blood in him.

143
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:13,480
Yeah!
I do too!

144
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,524
We're just gonna have to
carry them one by one.

145
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,610
Come on, you guys.

146
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,537
Check it out, you guys.
I'm calf curling.

147
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,280
Man, these calves
smell like crap.

148
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,547
I don't see how you're gonna
hide them much longer.

149
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,548
We won't have to.

150
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:40,692
Butters said he had something

151
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,036
that makes baby cows strong
again.

152
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:42,968
He's bringing it over.

153
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,293
Butters had that at his house?

154
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,386
Hey, fellas!

155
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:46,972
Butters, did you bring it?

156
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:47,931
I sure did!

157
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,100
We'll have those poor
baby cows in shape in no time!

158
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,225
All right!

159
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,020
"Suzanne Somers Calf Exerciser".

160
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:53,937
What?

161
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,940
"Makes your calves stronger
in just two days."

162
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,401
Oh, God damn it!
That's your plan?

163
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:00,861
You think it's a gimmick?

164
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,364
Suzanne promises
right on the box that it works.

165
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,201
Hello, Mrs. Marsh!

166
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,161
Officer Barbrady.
What can I do for you?

167
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,913
Well, we've got
a little problem.

168
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,623
Jed here caught your boy
and his friends

169
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,083
trespassing on his ranch.

170
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,918
They stole some of his property.

171
00:06:16,043 --> 00:06:17,753
Stole?
A-Are you sure?

172
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,339
I followed a calf-curling trail
right to your house, ma'am.

173
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,175
Ooh, Stan's in trouble!
Let me kick his ass, Mom!

174
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,219
N-Now, my son is not a thief.

175
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:27,596
I'm sure this is just
some kind of misunderstanding.

176
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,768
Stanley, did you see...

177
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,770
Oh, crap!

178
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,695
Stanley, what are you doing
with those calves?

179
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,708
That asshole was gonna kill them
and feed them to people!

180
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,359
Stanley, they belong to him.

181
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:41,652
They don't belong to anybody!

182
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:43,338
Please, Mom!
We don't want these cows to die!

183
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,238
Let me hit him, Mom!

184
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,031
Stanley, this isn't up
for discussion.

185
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,717
The rancher is going to take
his cows back,

186
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:50,244
and you don't have a choice.

187
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,875
Stanley!

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,545
Stanley, open this door right
now, or you're gonna get it!

189
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,212
No!

190
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,964
Stan, you're behaving
like a kid.

191
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,316
You're the ones
who made me eat veal

192
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,401
without telling me what it was!

193
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:05,425
You're the ones who knew

194
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,070
we were making
little baby animals suffer!

195
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,470
Open this door now!

196
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,595
Kiss my ass!

197
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,598
Oh, geez.
He said "ass" to his parents.

198
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,308
You're getting in
pretty deep, dude.

199
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,353
I apologize for this,
Mister rancher person.

200
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,106
Why don't you just tell them
that the cows will be safe?

201
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,875
And when they come out,
I can take 'em back.

202
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,317
I can't lie to my son, okay?

203
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,796
If I betrayed him like that, I'd
pay for it the rest of my life.

204
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,904
Well, that's just too bad!

205
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,115
Look, that's $800
worth of veal up there,

206
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,575
and I have to ship it out
Friday!

207
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,493
What are you going to do,
Officer Barbrady?

208
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,871
Me?
How'd I get into this mess?

209
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,415
So, what happens now?

210
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,300
I'm gonna lock myself in here
with these cows

211
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,311
until we have a guarantee
of their safety in writing.

212
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,712
- We're with you, dude.
- Yeah!

213
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:42,838
Don't be so sure.

214
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,257
Because I'm gonna tell you...
This is gonna get ugly.

215
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,382
Real ugly.

216
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,194
When all is said and done,
you could all be looking

217
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,471
at being grounded for three,
perhaps even four weeks.

218
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:52,890
So if any of you guys want out,
just say the word now.

219
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,391
- I want out.
- Shut up, Cartman.

220
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:55,716
- We're with you, Stan.
- Yeah.

221
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,811
We can't let
those little baby cows down.

222
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,396
They've got no one else
to turn to.

223
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,361
Then it's settled.
One for all and all for one!

224
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,274
Except Cartman.

225
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:02,858
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

226
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,151
Yeah!
Wait. What?

227
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,198
And so that's the situation.

228
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,241
Our boys have locked themselves
in Stan's room

229
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,678
until we can promise the calves
will live free, in writing.

230
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,120
Well, this is ridiculous.

231
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,747
I don't know how you raise
your kids,

232
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:19,291
but my son does not play
negotiator with me!

233
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,416
Well, excuse me, Sheila,

234
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,710
but it wasn't that simple.

235
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:25,464
Give me 15 seconds with Kyle,
and I'll have that door open.

236
00:08:26,882 --> 00:08:28,884
Kyle, this is your mother!

237
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,386
You will open this door
right now!

238
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,513
No, I won't.

239
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,389
Yes.
I see what you mean, Sheila.

240
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,515
That was very impressive.

241
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,267
Kyle, if you don't do
as you're told,

242
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,269
I'm going to be very angry!

243
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,581
Well, you made me eat veal
and didn't tell me what it was!

244
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,025
So go ahead and be angry,
you baby-cow-killing bitch!

245
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,026
Very persuasive.

246
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,278
Aah! Open this door!
Open this door!

247
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,947
Oh, let... let me try.

248
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,490
Butters?

249
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,325
Butters, this is your father.

250
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,202
Oh, sweet Jesus.
What do I do?

251
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,096
Be strong, Butters.
You knew it would come to this.

252
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,580
Butters, answer me.

253
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,332
But... But Dad's a-angry at me.

254
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,167
Don't panic.
I'll tell you what to say.

255
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,794
Butters, right now!

256
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:07,047
Dad, uh, why don't you
suck my fat one?

257
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,924
- What?!
- Oh, sweet Jesus.

258
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,735
- What's gotten into them?
- All right, Stanley.

259
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,053
This has gone on long enough.
Your little game is over!

260
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:14,178
This isn't a game, Mom.

261
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,449
We're not coming out until we
know the calves will be safe.

262
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:17,266
Well, that's fine.

263
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,410
You boys can just stay in there
and starve to death.

264
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,728
Us parents are going to go
to Pizza Shack

265
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,814
and have pepperoni pizzas
and ice cream.

266
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,941
Oh, God damn it, you guys.

267
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,568
Cartman, stay away
from that door!

268
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,736
You'll have to come
out sooner or later, boys.

269
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,656
The longer you wait,
the more trouble you'll be in.

270
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:37,452
Round one is over.
We made it.

271
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,458
We didn't make it.
Your mom is right, douchebag.

272
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,099
What are we gonna do,
stay in here until we starve?

273
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,392
Our parents would never
let us starve.

274
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,167
They're bluffing.
This is a battle of wills.

275
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,013
If we hold out long enough,
they'll give in.

276
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:47,337
But we will have to sleep, dude.

277
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,148
Three of us can sleep
while one keeps watch.

278
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,492
We'll shift
every couple of hours.

279
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,051
Hey, this is gonna be
just like Vietnam, huh, fellas?

280
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:53,885
Whoopie!

281
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,697
We'll stay in this room
with these baby cows

282
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,514
for as long as it takes!

283
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,690
Well, we tried everything.

284
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,255
We can't get through the door
without tearing apart the house.

285
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,486
Dear God!
It's been over 13 hours.

286
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,239
Oh, but my poor little poopsie
must be getting so hungry.

287
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,884
Maybe we should get them
a little food.

288
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,743
Ms. Cartman,
this is a battle of will.

289
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,412
We need our boys to know that
we're not gonna cave in at all.

290
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,788
Oh, all right.

291
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,017
Let's just go to bed and
let them play their little game

292
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,167
for as long as they can.

293
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,504
- Good night, fellas!
- Good night.

294
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,423
Good night, Patches.
Good night, Halloway.

295
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,258
Good night, Neptune.
Good night, Davis.

296
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,426
Good night, Bud.

297
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,136
Good night, Red.
Good night, Paulette.

298
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,387
Good night, Chastity.

299
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,390
Butters, I'm going to kill
you over and over again.

300
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:49,191
Can't go on.

301
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,567
Need... food.

302
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,903
I didn't realize hunger
made you feel so bad.

303
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,548
There's only one alternative,
you guys.

304
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:55,906
We're gonna have to eat a calf.

305
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,574
No, Cartman,
we're not eating a calf.

306
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,077
All right! Then we're gonna
have to eat Butters.

307
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,244
He might be right, dude.

308
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,370
Aw, heck.

309
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,831
Wait.
What is that?

310
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,458
- Dude!
- Food!

311
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,127
Ms. Cartman, what are you doing?

312
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,630
Ooh, I just can't stand
to see my baby suffer.

313
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,840
Oh, dear God.
You've ruined everything!

314
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:14,591
All right!

315
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:16,301
See?
Now we can hold out for weeks!

316
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,053
Look, you guys!
Beef jerky!

317
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,138
- Yeah! And fried chicken!
- Wha...?

318
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,974
Dude, what are you guys doing?

319
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,351
We're eating, dude.

320
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,519
You're eating meat!

321
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,538
What the hell do you think
we're doing all this for?

322
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,648
Hey, I'm doing it
to save little baby cows.

323
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,413
I'm not gonna stop eating meat
altogether.

324
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,442
- Me neither.
- Yeah.

325
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,379
If you don't eat meat at all,
you become a pussy.

326
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:36,238
That's fine.
You guys can live off of flesh.

327
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,698
But I'm never eating meat again.

328
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,157
Go ahead.
That's more for us.

329
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,742
You want some beef jerky, buddy?

330
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,867
Yes.
Who's your buddy?

331
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,328
Who's hungry?
Who's a hungry man?

332
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,706
Dude, that's messed up.

333
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,716
You guys, check this out!

334
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,384
Tom, I'm standing
in front of the house

335
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,679
where four insane boy terrorists
have barricaded themselves

336
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,515
inside a room
with 23 live infant cattle.

337
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Hey, look!

338
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,144
Some other kids are doing
the same thing we are!

339
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,479
Several attempts
to break into the room

340
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,274
have proven unsuccessful, Tom,
and the crisis is intensifying.

341
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,900
Here's what some people
had to say.

342
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,318
We were just sleeping,

343
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:17,070
when suddenly we heard
all the commotion.

344
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:19,072
I mean, to think
this could happen right here

345
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,615
in our own community.

346
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:22,576
We gave those kids everything,

347
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,036
and they turned into
little John Walkers.

348
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,747
The police chief of South Park

349
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,416
says that there will be no
negotiations with terrorists.

350
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,835
Oh, no. This is big-time
trouble now, fellas.

351
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,420
No.
This is exactly what we wanted.

352
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,130
- It is?
- Yes. Don't you see?

353
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,858
This validates everything
that we're doing.

354
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:37,758
If we're making the news,

355
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,193
this is obviously important
to people.

356
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,052
Tom, it looks like
I have an update.

357
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,305
Yes, it looks like
the boy-terrorist story

358
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,599
is not interesting news
to anyone.

359
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,476
Uh, nothing else
was going on, Tom,

360
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,829
so this was the only story
we had to make seem important,

361
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,480
but people are just simply
tuning out.

362
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,690
So HBC will now be
switching programming

363
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,985
once again to
"Puppies From Around the World"!

364
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,588
I don't believe it.

365
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,424
The Chinese puppy is my favorite
so far!

366
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,516
Butters?

367
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,309
B-Butters, you have your arm
around me!

368
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,311
Oh, sorry.
I thought you were Mr. Pickles.

369
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,396
We must help the helpless.

370
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,690
We must save the unsaved.

371
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:36,817
What the hell is that?

372
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,819
For if we fight together.

373
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,779
We can make sure
the road is paved.

374
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,906
For a brighter tomorrow...

375
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,658
- Hippies!
- What are they doing here?

376
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:45,867
We are with you, boys!

377
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,578
Your message is real
and your fight is just!

378
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,123
Dude, those gaywads
are on our side?

379
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:53,875
Ew!
They're all dirty.

380
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,040
What did I tell you, Stan?

381
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,646
We saved some baby cows
from being eaten,

382
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,464
and now we're no-good,
dirty Goddamn hippies!

383
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,385
Tom, the calf-terrorist standoff continues,

384
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,181
as now members of the FBI arrive
to put an end to the conflict.

385
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,474
Oh, Jesus Christ.

386
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,934
Who's in charge here?

387
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,644
I am.
But I don't want to be.

388
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,854
Where's the negotiator?

389
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,398
Right here...
Glen Dumont, negotiator squad.

390
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,723
All right.
See what you can do.

391
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,820
- Dude, are you okay?
- Oh, I just feel so run down.

392
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,821
I don't know what's wrong
with me.

393
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,031
- I've got these sores.
- What is that?

394
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,700
- Dude, maybe we should end this.
- No!

395
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,369
Get me a hard line to the phone
in that house.

396
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,574
The terrorists already said

397
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,247
there's no way
they're coming out.

398
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,748
Don't worry.
I'm a negotiator.

399
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,394
It's my job to talk
to freaks like this

400
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,960
and bring about
a peaceful resolution

401
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,920
using clever psychology.

402
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,006
Hello?

403
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,633
Hello. My name is Mike.
I'm a negotiator.

404
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,218
Is it okay if I talk to you?

405
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,029
Uh, hold on.
It's some negotiator named Mike.

406
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,573
- What do I do?
- Don't give him anything!

407
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,390
- What do I say?
- Aw, give me that.

408
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,641
Talk to me, Mike.

409
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,935
I'm here to make sure
we can all end this peacefully.

410
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,228
You want that, right?

411
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:56,479
Sure, sure.

412
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,731
How about we make a trade

413
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,524
just to show
that we can trust each other?

414
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,649
What'd you have in mind?

415
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,445
Well, how about you send out
one of the calves?

416
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,370
Oh, Mike. You're breaking
my balls here, Mike.

417
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,823
Just one.
That's all we want.

418
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,074
All right.
How about this?

419
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,927
You guys have all the leverage,
and we have nothing.

420
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:11,369
So how about we give you
one calf...

421
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,287
- Cartman, no!
- Dude!

422
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,121
It's cool.

423
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,290
We'll give you one calf
if you'll give us

424
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,958
some guns and ammunition
of our own.

425
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,418
What?
I-I can't do that!

426
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:19,812
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were talking here.

427
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,063
But I guess you're not
talking to me. Goodbye.

428
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,672
No, no. Wait.
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

429
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,841
Y-You're right. What reason
do you have to trust me?

430
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,135
I'm just a guy from Lakewood
trying to make ends meet.

431
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,970
Just a blue-collar guy
like your dad.

432
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,698
Don't have a dad, Mike.
That's not gonna work.

433
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:34,267
Oh. All right. Some guns.
I'll see what I can do.

434
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,145
Okay.
Up a little.

435
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,856
Left a little.
Almost there.

436
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,857
What is that?

437
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:43,443
We're giving the boys some guns
in return for a calf.

438
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,320
- What?
- You're giving my baby guns?

439
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,572
Hey, this is a negotiation
process, okay?

440
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,324
Did you people go
to negotiator school?

441
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,492
No, you didn't!

442
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,243
Get 'em on the line for me.

443
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,995
Hello?

444
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,040
Okay. You see that?
I keep my end of the bargain.

445
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,204
All right. We'll keep ours.
We'll send out one calf.

446
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,585
Well, h-how about you send out
two calves?

447
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,088
Oh, Jesus! There's just no
talking to you, is there, Mike?

448
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,192
We had a deal.
Do you think I'm stupid?

449
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,526
Don't treat me
like I'm stupid here!

450
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,550
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

451
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,678
Damn it!
I'm losing them!

452
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,930
Okay. I'm sorry.
Just send out one calf.

453
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:14,241
Oh, no, no, no. Now you're gonna
have to get us something else.

454
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,265
What'd you have in mind?

455
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,896
A little to the left.

456
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,565
Okay. That's good.
A little to the right.

457
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,984
You're giving them a missile?!

458
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,986
Stand down, ma'am!
Stand down!

459
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,571
This is a delicate process.
I've almost earned their trust.

460
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,490
Stan's getting worse, you guys.

461
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,326
- Mike. Babe.
- How we doing?

462
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,679
We got a real sick kid here,
Mike.

463
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,888
Did you get the other things
for us?

464
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,956
I-I did manage to get the FDA

465
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:41,543
to officially change the word
"veal" to "tortured baby cow."

466
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,377
Good. Good.

467
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,754
But I couldn't get you
North and South Dakota.

468
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,007
Oh, Mike.
Breaking my balls, Mike.

469
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:49,342
Now... Now, please, can...
Can we get you to come out?

470
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,555
All right.
Everything has worked out.

471
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,265
The boys have promised
to come out

472
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,683
and bring the cows out
with them.

473
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,143
All right!

474
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,937
I'm sorry I doubted
your abilities, Mr. Negotiator.

475
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,647
- They're coming out now?
- Yes.

476
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,232
All we need to do in return
is get

477
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,651
a cattle-transporting semitruck
that will take the boys

478
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,337
and the cattle
to Denver International Airport,

479
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,839
where we will have
a fully gassed airplane

480
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,322
waiting to take them all
to Mexico.

481
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:11,990
What?

482
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,301
And they want the guy that
plays Mr. Worf on "Star Trek"

483
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,786
to drive the truck...
In full makeup.

484
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,163
Jesus Christ!

485
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,372
All right.
That does it!

486
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,499
You are, in fact,
the worst negotiator

487
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,168
I've ever seen in action!

488
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,812
All right. All right.
I'll give you that.

489
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,921
But in return,
I want three staples.

490
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:27,922
Get out of here!

491
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:29,174
We'll get them the semi,

492
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,219
and we'll get them the Worf guy
from "Star Trek."

493
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,054
If they see that, they'll come
out, and then we can take them.

494
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,430
But isn't that dishonest?

495
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,431
Maybe so.

496
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:37,932
But if we don't do something
soon,

497
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,893
there could be 50,
even 60 people

498
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,770
who'll have to go without veal
for dinner.

499
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,397
Are you prepared
to let that happen?

500
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,072
All right.
Where is Mr. Dorn?

501
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,782
I was woken up
at 3:00 in the morning,

502
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,867
told I had to put on makeup
and come to this town.

503
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,949
What the hell is going on?

504
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,912
I'm sorry, Mr. Dorn.
It's FBI business.

505
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:01,357
We've got terrorists making
demands, and we need your help.

506
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,916
This is highly unusual.

507
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,310
All right, boys.
We have your truck.

508
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,878
And we have an airplane on the
tarmac at Denver International.

509
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:07,879
And Worf?

510
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:11,091
My name is Michael Dorn.
I play a character called Worf.

511
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,258
Stan, it worked!

512
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:13,510
It did?

513
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,637
They got us a truck
and an airplane and Mr. Worf!

514
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,305
The calves are gonna be okay!

515
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,599
Pick me up.
I-I want to see.

516
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,899
Step back!
Tell those men to step back!

517
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,400
Do it!

518
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:36,366
Aw, shut up,
you friggin' hippies.

519
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,035
All right, Mr. Worf.

520
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,471
Start the engine
and put her in gear.

521
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,455
Oh, and you must refer to me
as "Captain".

522
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,124
Where am I supposed to drive to?

523
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,249
No, see, you must say,

524
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,043
"Captain, where am I supposed to
drive to?"

525
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,171
Captain, where am I
supposed to drive to?

526
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,056
You're going to back the truck
up to the door

527
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,484
so we can safely load in
the calves.

528
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,843
This whole thing is ridiculous.

529
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,220
"Captain, this whole thing
is ridiculous."

530
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:59,848
Captain, this whole thing
is ridiculous.

531
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,310
Okay!
All set!

532
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:05,979
Tom, it looks as though the terrorists

533
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,149
are now loading the baby cows
into the back of a semi.

534
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,734
This is still
very uninteresting news, Tom.

535
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,861
Okay, Cartman!

536
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,904
Step on it, Mr. Worf!

537
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,447
All right!

538
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:17,782
We're going!

539
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,117
Mexico, here we come!

540
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,874
Wait a minute.
They're following us!

541
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,250
Full speed, Mr. Worf!

542
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,711
We cannot keep going fast
on these icy roads.

543
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,338
"Captain, we cannot keep
going fast on these icy roads."

544
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,216
Captain, we cannot keep
going fast on these icy roads.

545
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,217
All right, Mr. Worf.

546
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,342
Then reduce speed to 45

547
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,305
but maintain distance
from those police cruisers.

548
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,056
Stan, we're almost there.
You've got to hold on.

549
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,911
All right. They're in front
of the cattle ranch.

550
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,020
Hit it!

551
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,568
Oh, it's a double cross!

552
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,403
All right, boys.
The game is over.

553
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,088
Get out of the truck
with your hands up.

554
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,115
Oh, no.
No!

555
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,000
What are you waiting for?
Go kill them, Worf!

556
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,535
I'm not killing anybody.

557
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,787
Some goddamn Klingon you are.

558
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,670
We're sorry, cows.
We tried. We tried.

559
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:13,671
All right, boys.

560
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,882
Just stay right there
until your parents arrive.

561
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:16,799
Can I go now?

562
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:20,511
Here you go, Mr. Rancher.
I got your cattle back for you!

563
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,764
Well, it doesn't matter now.

564
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:23,765
What do you mean?

565
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,433
In the 24 hours
since the word "veal"

566
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,019
was officially changed
to "little tortured baby cow,"

567
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:29,562
the market has gone dry.

568
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,567
Seems when people see
"little tortured baby cow"

569
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,448
on their menus,
they don't feel like ordering.

570
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:34,025
Really?

571
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,693
Damn things ain't worth spit
now.

572
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,504
I'll let 'em live outside
with the other cows

573
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:38,571
and live a normal life.

574
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:39,948
You hear that, Stan?
It worked!

575
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,116
We've shut down
the veal industry!

576
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,326
Stan?

577
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,744
Stan?

578
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,182
He's very lucky you got him here
when you did.

579
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,541
He was in a very advanced state
of vaginitis.

580
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,876
Vaginitis?

581
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,045
It occurs when a person
stops eating meat.

582
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,464
Those sores on his skin
were actually small vaginas.

583
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,966
If we hadn't stopped it in time,

584
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,592
Stan would've eventually
just become

585
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,511
one great big, giant pussy.

586
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,637
Whoa, dude.

587
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,305
We've got an I.V.
of pure beef blood

588
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,683
pumping into Stan's veins,
and the sores are fading.

589
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,309
Thank God we stopped it in time.

590
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,870
Well, I guess
we learned something today.

591
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:10,894
It's wrong to eat veal

592
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,748
because the animals
are so horribly mistreated.

593
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,108
But if you don't eat meat at
all, you break out in vaginas.

594
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,025
Hear, hear.

595
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,777
All right, boys.
It's time to go home.

596
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,988
You've got some serious
grounding time to start.

597
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,198
- I'll say!
- Aw, we're still grounded?

598
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,826
But... But we... we learned
things and took up a cause.

599
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:27,036
Yes, Kyle, but you still
defied your parents.

600
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:30,039
And you need to learn that
terrorism is never the answer.

601
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,364
That's right. Let's get
these terrorists to their rooms.

602
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,086
But first maybe we can grab
some burgers.

603
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,546
Alright!!
